# node_framework
This is a basic framework I use to sandbox some new new methodologies and play with new components. 
It's not a finished project, but something I toy with in when I'm bored. 
Most custom functionality has been removed and it's not a working copy. This codebase as well as the 
php codebase is just to display my current coding style and proficiency. 

#Disclaimer
I haven't actually worked on this framework in a while as most of my pastime is rebuilding this 
in Typescript.
